# Ruby Coding Challenges Repository

Welcome to my Ruby coding challenges repository! ðŸŽ‰  

Here, you'll find solutions to a variety of coding challenges from different LeetCode study plans. These challenges cover diverse topics, including but not limited to:  
- **Programming Skills:** Sharpening foundational programming concepts.  
- **Functional Programming:** Embracing immutability, higher-order functions, and more.  
- **Data Structures & Algorithms:** Exploring efficient problem-solving techniques.  
- **Other Thematic Topics:** Delving into arrays, strings, recursion, and beyond.  

Each solution is written in Ruby, showcasing clean and readable code with an emphasis on best practices. This repository is a work in progress and will continue to grow as I tackle new challenges.  

Feel free to explore, suggest improvements, or share your own insights! ðŸš€
